                                    In doubles play (where there are two players on each side), the serving order must be rotated after each game. Players must serve from the right service court when the score is even, and from the left service court when the score is odd.

                                    A fault is committed when a player violates one of the rules of the game. Examples of faults include serving incorrectly, hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds, or hitting the shuttlecock before it has crossed the net. If a player commits a fault, their opponent wins the rally.

                                    A rally is won when the shuttlecock lands in your opponent’s court, or when your opponent hits the shuttlecock out of bounds or into the net. Points can only be scored by the serving side, and the first side to reach 21 points (with a margin of at least two points) wins the game.

                            Varying the speed and power of your shots can make you a more unpredictable opponent and keep your opponents on their toes. Here are a few ways you can change the speed of your shots:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use a lighter grip on your racket: By using a lighter grip on your racket, you’ll be able to hit softer shots that have less power and spin. This can be useful for hitting drop shots or for placing the shuttlecock in a specific part of the court.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Add spin to the shuttlecock: By adding topspin or backspin to the shuttlecock, you’ll be able to slow it down and make it dip more after it crosses the net. This can be useful for hitting deceptive shots or for setting up a slower, more controlled rally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hit the shuttlecock earlier or later in its descent: By hitting the shuttlecock earlier or later in its descent, you’ll be able to change the pace of the rally. Hitting the shuttlecock earlier will give it more power and speed, while hitting it later will give it less power and spin.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to these techniques, it’s also important to vary the placement of your shots. By hitting the shuttlecock to different parts of the court, you’ll be able to keep your opponents guessing and force them to move around the court.
